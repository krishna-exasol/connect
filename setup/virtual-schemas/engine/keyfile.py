"""A credential the driver reads only from a file: BigQuery's service-account key.

Simba's BigQuery driver (1.7.0.1001) takes the key only as a file path
(OAuthPvtKeyPath) or inline in the URL; measured on Exasol Personal, a key in
the CONNECTION's password is refused ("Required Connection Key(s):
OAuthPvtKeyPath"). So the kit writes the key to BucketFS, one file per source,
owner-only on this computer (the adapter still reads it - measured), and the
URL names its path - never the key. Any database user who may create scripts
can read BucketFS, so the kit names such users (lifecycle.script_readers).

Checked here before anything is staged: that the text is a service-account
key, and an e-mail address the URL can carry without changing its meaning.
